      We have 3 owners. Our group goes back further than the company. See it all
      started when Joe started to work with Dylan and Thomas in geometry class.
      During the course of the year ocasionally we would get to a difficult
      problem and Thomas would try and brute force questions in the worst way
      possible. This ended up in the saying "Messa has idea." Which is said in a
      mix of a Jar Jar Binks and Yoda accent.
      <br /><br />
      It is non debateable who did most the work that year. Class usually ended
      up with Dylan doing the work. Thomas helping Dylan do the math or playing
      Mario on his calculator. Joe was doing something. The delacate balence of
      doing work was held together by Dylan. One day Dylan didn't show up and
      Thomas and Joe managed to goof off the entire class period and not do any
      of the assinged work.
