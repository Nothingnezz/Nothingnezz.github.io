    </h2>
    <p>
      Goose Music a small 3 memeber band owned by Goose Records coming out of
      the great city of Fort Thomas. The group goes back further than the band.
      See it all started when Joe started to work with Dylan and Thomas in
      geometry class. During the course of the year ocasionally we would get to
      a difficult problem and Thomas would try and brutee force questions in the
      worst way possible. This ended up in the saying "Messa has idea." Which is
      said in a mix of a Jar Jar Binks and Yoda accent.

      about math applications and concepts, but it was really an intro to
      business class.
